It has mostly all the courses in Engineering, MBA, MBBS, Pharmacy, etc. They are having a vast area with a good infrastructure. The facilities like hostel facilities are also available at the campus. The college is approximately 10 km far from NH-8 and convenient transportation facility is also available.\n",

      "\n",
      "413) College is not up to the mark for academics. The attendance is more important than gaining knowledge in this college. But, the campus infrastructure and the crowd is quite good. The placement is average. There's no difference between the campus hostel and the central jail. And the college canteen provides wide varieties of food. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food is available.\n",

      "416) Teachers are really good except one or two. But administration is really bad. They don't know, how to manage students, their shifts and all. They have buildings built everywhere inside the campus and that too close to each other. This makes students live very difficult in summer because, there is no place for air to pass, it's simply packed up. Placement department is led by a very talented person. So, that makes it very good. The owner just wants money from students, that's why he creates new b...\n",

      "\n",
      "419) Currently one of the best campus in entire Gujarat. Awesome infrastructure. Teaching quality is very good. All facilities under one roof apart from that student’s friendly environment and much more than expectation. I studied BE Mechanical over here. I can proudly say that it has best facility in terms industrial visit, machinery, updated equipment, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "420) It is the best college in my opinion. It is affiliated with GTU and gives high standard of education with theoretical as well as practical knowledge. Lots of festivals and other events are held by the organisation of the students. The college also provides its students with an opportunity to take part in student exchange programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "421) The college is very good. Infrastructure and facilities are really amazing. Teaching staff is also great. But lacks in laboratory experiments. And too much emphasis is put on laborious written work, instead the focussing on practical application of the knowledge. And yes, the exposure students get is amazing because of so many extra-curricular activities like international student exchange or projects, etc. So all in all, it is a good college.\n",
      "\n",
      "422) Campus is the best part. Faculty not up to the mark on a majority. Atmosphere lacks healthy competition. Placement scenario is good. The course outlines are too restricted and don’t provide students a chance to widen their horizon of knowledge. Campus life is not too interesting. Attendance is an issue and is very stringent which kind of pressurizes students to attend without an intension to attend.\n",
      "\n",
      "423) It is a good college but too much strict about attendances. Placement is very good. Security guards of college are not good due to their attitude. Teaching is first class. Also facilities provided are good. Campus life is awesome. Hostel is good. Extra-curricular activities are arranged which is very helpful for students.\n",
      "\n",
      "424) One of the best infrastructural facilities in state of Gujarat. A very hard working training and placement department. A college which believes in innovations. College also has a research and development department which helps young enlightened minds to pursue their goal. There is one thing which I didn’t like is they are very strict. Rules and regulations are more of school then of college.\n",
      "\n",
      "425) It is the best college for educational purposes. And also phones are not allowed so one can concentrate on studies better. Also there are lots of other colleges in it, actually it is a part of Parul University. I can recommend this college for good facilities as well as education.\n",
      "\n",
      "426) Parul College is really an excellent college ever in whole Gujarat. It is a right place for the students who seriously want to study, but it is a very worst college ever for the students who wants to enjoy a college life.  Parul College will make you sharpen in overall criteria including your personality, discipline and in other curriculum activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "427) It is a college which describes about its capabilities through its security. The teaching over here is average. But the management is superb. Very crowded campus. Attendance is compulsory otherwise the student will get detained. The main thing is there is more importance given to the security of a person than to the faculty or the students. Much restricted college.\n",

This may have changed because it has recently became a University. But Parul University might be the best college of Vadodara.\n",
      "\n",
      "431) If you are searching for the best college campus (not talking about campus placement) & you don't have money problem then choose Parul. Its infrastructure is too big. It has the best quality of hostel, food, canteen, ATM & bank facilities, college ground, cultural activities, tech fest, festival celebration, & yes teaching also. You can enjoy your full college life over here. It's actually located out of the town, 12 km away from the city area, so there remains a kind of silence after college ho...\n",

Workshops are regularly conducted as a part of additional activities. Pros:- 1) good experienced faculty 2) placements in TCS, l and InfoTech, etc. 3) Regular workshops, seminars, industrial visits (7-10) overall. 4) Career development cell for placement preparation. 5) Transport facilities are good. 6) Food court 7) Lush green campus ...\n",
      "\n",
      "436) Good college. Location is good. There is nice placement and campus is very good. And now that college has become Parul University, so it is a big college right now.

      "As campus placement wise college is too low. During my passing year from CE, EC and IT total 32 student got placed to TCS (26) and Infosys (6) only. Don't know the current status might got improved because campus wise it improved too much after I left.\n",
      "About cultural fest & tech fest this is the best campus yo...\n",
      "\n",
      "439) It's a trustee run college. Decent infrastructure but there's a need of good qualified and experienced teachers. It just seems like a corporate running two shifts and 50-60 students stuffed in a room. There are over 300 seats for each branch of engineering. Are they able to place so many candidates at the end of the course? Obviously not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do not blindly get into colleges and courses. Weigh your options carefully.\n",

      "\n",
      "Only some problematic part is that there are procedure for everything i.e. fee collection documentation etc. it includes big processes which can also be done shortly and sometimes the admin staff does not cooperate, except that college is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "443) It was a very good college with all required facility and good environment. Very good platform provided to grow, learn and reach beyond the boundries of achievement and learnings.

The companies like Infosys, TCS, Paytm, etc. visited the campus for placements. The college has also got a placement cell and placement head who is resourceful at every moment.The infrastructure of the college is the best part of the campus. The campus including Wi-Fi, labs are always in good condition except for monsoon, library facilities are extremely good as there's also a reading room for the students. There isn't much of a problem about medical facilities as there is a Hospital in the Campus. The classrooms are CCTV secured, but benches may be a problem as they are a bit old.\n",

Companies for computer and information technology are huge in numbers. There were not much of opportunities yet for other branches. May be because of the market trend but we expect more companies of other core branches in the month of December and January. The past history of placement seems to be good.Infrastructure is something that this college can take proud for. Buildings are properly built. Cleanliness in the campus is omnipresent. There are gardens. Trees surround the whole walking area. Besides the main canteen, there are other canteens and a food court as well. You get a number of options to eat. Wi-Fi facility is available.

      "The campus infrastructure is excellent and Parul university ranks in the top 10 B-school of India.\n",

      "938) Parul University is one of the reputed colleges in Vadodara in the state of Gujarat. It has mostly all the courses in Engineering, MBA, MBBS, Pharmacy, etc. They are having a vast area with a good infrastructure. The facilities like hostel facilities are also available at the campus. The college is approximately 10 km far from NH-8 and convenient transportation facility is also available.\n",
      "\n",
      "939) The faculty was good and very good facilities provided by the college. The crowd was a mixture of a variety of students. The infrastructure is very good. The placements were not good and training for industrial purposes was not provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "940) College is not up to the mark for academics. The attendance is more important than gaining knowledge in this college. But, the campus infrastructure and the crowd is quite good. The placement is average. There's no difference between the campus hostel and the central jail. And the college canteen provides wide varieties of food. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "941) College infrastructure is good. Attendance is mandatory in our college. Good facilities are provided to the students but teaching is a bit poor. This college is good for computer science engineering students because various companies often for campus drive.\n",

      "942) The Good -1) Cool HODs 2) You can always attribute your inability to teach to the student’s inability to understand. \n",
      "The Bad-1) High handedness of management 2) Faculty and students treated alike by security staff. Advice to Management Please trust your staff and don't make them feel like they are being watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "943) Teachers are really good except one or two. But administration is really bad. They don't know, how to manage students, their shifts and all. They have buildings built everywhere inside the campus and that too close to each other. This makes students live very difficult in summer because, there is no place for air to pass, it's simply packed up. Placement department is led by a very talented person. So, that makes it very good. The owner just wants money from students, that's why he creates new b...\n",

      "\n",
      "946) Currently one of the best campus in entire Gujarat. Awesome infrastructure. Teaching quality is very good. All facilities under one roof apart from that student’s friendly environment and much more than expectation. I studied BE Mechanical over here. I can proudly say that it has best facility in terms industrial visit, machinery, updated equipment, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "947) It is the best college in my opinion. It is affiliated with GTU and gives high standard of education with theoretical as well as practical knowledge. Lots of festivals and other events are held by the organisation of the students. The college also provides its students with an opportunity to take part in student exchange programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "948) The college is very good. Infrastructure and facilities are really amazing. Teaching staff is also great. But lacks in laboratory experiments. And too much emphasis is put on laborious written work, instead the focussing on practical application of the knowledge. And yes, the exposure students get is amazing because of so many extra-curricular activities like international student exchange or projects, etc. So all in all, it is a good college.\n",
      "\n",
      "949) Campus is the best part. Faculty not up to the mark on a majority. Atmosphere lacks healthy competition. Placement scenario is good. The course outlines are too restricted and don’t provide students a chance to widen their horizon of knowledge. Campus life is not too interesting. Attendance is an issue and is very stringent which kind of pressurizes students to attend without an intension to attend.\n",
      "\n",
      "950) It is a good college but too much strict about attendances. Placement is very good. Security guards of college are not good due to their attitude. Teaching is first class. Also facilities provided are good. Campus life is awesome. Hostel is good. Extra-curricular activities are arranged which is very helpful for students.\n",
      "\n",
      "951) One of the best infrastructural facilities in state of Gujarat. A very hard working training and placement department. A college which believes in innovations. College also has a research and development department which helps young enlightened minds to pursue their goal. There is one thing which I didn’t like is they are very strict. Rules and regulations are more of school then of college.\n",
      "\n",
      "952) It is the best college for educational purposes. And also phones are not allowed so one can concentrate on studies better. Also there are lots of other colleges in it, actually it is a part of Parul University. I can recommend this college for good facilities as well as education.\n",
      "\n",
      "953) Parul College is really an excellent college ever in whole Gujarat. It is a right place for the students who seriously want to study, but it is a very worst college ever for the students who wants to enjoy a college life.  Parul College will make you sharpen in overall criteria including your personality, discipline and in other curriculum activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "954) It is a college which describes about its capabilities through its security. The teaching over here is average. But the management is superb. Very crowded campus. Attendance is compulsory otherwise the student will get detained. The main thing is there is more importance given to the security of a person than to the faculty or the students. Much restricted college.\n",
      "\n",
      "955) My college Parul Institute of engineering and technology is situated in Vadodara, Gujarat. PIET organises many events for students’ welfare. Faculty in here are qualified in their respective fields, so gaining knowledge from them is fun and studying becomes easier. We have amenities like gym, swimming pool, garden, cricket ground, basketball court, etc. It is a combination of learning, plus being healthy here.

      "\n",
      "957) Worst college. You need to maintain 70% attendance otherwise they may detain you. Placement cell is the only good thing about this college. Lots of opportunities are there. This may have changed because it has recently became a University. But Parul University might be the best college of Vadodara.\n",
      "\n",
      "958) If you are searching for the best college campus (not talking about campus placement) & you don't have money problem then choose Parul. Its infrastructure is too big. It has the best quality of hostel, food, canteen, ATM & bank facilities, college ground, cultural activities, tech fest, festival celebration, & yes teaching also. You can enjoy your full college life over here. It's actually located out of the town, 12 km away from the city area, so there remains a kind of silence after college ho...\n",
      "\n",

Workshops are regularly conducted as a part of additional activities. Pros:- 1) good experienced faculty 2) placements in TCS, l and InfoTech, etc. 3) Regular workshops, seminars, industrial visits (7-10) overall. 4) Career development cell for placement preparation. 5) Transport facilities are good. 6) Food court 7) Lush green campus ...\n",
      "\n",
      "963) Good college. Location is good. There is nice placement and campus is very good. And now that college has become Parul University, so it is a big college right now.

      "As campus placement wise college is too low. During my passing year from CE, EC and IT total 32 student got placed to TCS (26) and Infosys (6) only. Don't know the current status might got improved because campus wise it improved too much after I left.\n",
      "About cultural fest & tech fest this is the best campus yo...\n",
      "\n",
      "966) It's a trustee run college. Decent infrastructure but there's a need of good qualified and experienced teachers. It just seems like a corporate running two shifts and 50-60 students stuffed in a room. There are over 300 seats for each branch of engineering. Are they able to place so many candidates at the end of the course? Obviously not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do not blindly get into colleges and courses. Weigh your options carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "967) It isgood for study but there is no college environment like in every student life. We miss it badly. Faculty was good. \n",

      "\n",
      "Only some problematic part is that there are procedure for everything i.e. fee collection documentation etc. it includes big processes which can also be done shortly and sometimes the admin staff does not cooperate, except that college is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "970) It was a very good college with all required facility and good environment. Very good platform provided to grow, learn and reach beyond the boundries of achievement and learnings.
